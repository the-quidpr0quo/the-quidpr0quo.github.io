aller anfang ist schwer anfangen ist einfach beharrlichkeit eine kunst

Didn't expect myself to be an ethical hacker at all. When I was younger, I dreamt to be a lawyer. But now, I am glad I failed to become one.

Born and raised in a deeply-infested financial and materialistic society in the East, I used to work in the financial services industry like everyone else. A lot of changes since 2019 have and an awful lot of lifelong cultural and personal struggles have pushed me to here.
