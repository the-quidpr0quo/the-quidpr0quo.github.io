Quick Summary 
**Initial Foothold:** password credential image on SDcard directory of Android machine; 
**Privilege Escalation:** Port-forwarding of Android adb 5555 port and connect from Kali machine

## Normal Nmap Scan Results:
> In a quick port scanning, I applied the following switch on the target machine:
1. -sS TCP SYN (Stealth) Scan, +ve: unobtrusive and stealthy but also quick (https://nmap.org/book/synscan.html)
2. -sC Scan with default NSE scripts, +ve Considered useful for discovery and safe (https://www.stationx.net/nmap-cheat-sheet/)
3. -sV Attempts to determine the version of the service running on port (https://nmap.org/book/man-version-detection.html)

*However, you will soon realize I made a mistake in my initial scan here*

```

Here is an extract of the script:

  s.connect((host, port))
  print(s.recv(1024))

```
With only port 2222, it is barely sufficient for us to carry out the next attack and the script also stated that we would need a credential.
*Always scan with full-port scan*
Using the -p- on nmap, we discovered port 59777 is also open and as usual, we can either check the page by curl, web browser or make good use of fluffing (i.e. gobuster)

*Now here, there are a whole bunch of juicy directory here, if you are familiar with an Android device, you will discover that these come from an Android phone and /oem looks like sth useful.
An OEM may actually render an existence of usb drivers, sdcard (https://developer.android.com/studio/run/oem-usb)


Even though we are unable to discover anything juicy on the other directory OR the original bruteforce wordlist does not have an Android wordlist; we can try with different directories that may appear with an Android phone where oem is enabled --> an sdcard directory


![Credential](/assets/images/24701.png)

With such credential, we can now ssh in.

```
Kr1sT!5h@Rp3xPl0r3!
ssh kristi@10.10.10.247 -p 2222
```

*Initial foothold obtained but privilege escalation needed*

## Privilege Escalation

Enumerating from the inside, we have to check what kind of ports the phone is running open:
```
$ netstat -tulpn

```


It seems like the phone is also listening on port 5555, a further experience with Android phone, we will know that it is for adb, see link below (https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb?hl=lt)

What we can do now is to get in port 5555 by port-forwarding 

```
ssh -L 5555:127.0.0.1:5555 kristi@10.10.10.247 -p 2222
```

We can now interact with port 5555 of the android phone from our local port 5555; However, we must also install adb connect to get in

```
adb connect localhost:5555
connected to localhost:5555

root
```

Viola~ We were able to get in and root dance for an Android machine



## Comments
A rather medium staged machine, with some Android mobile experience needed; Port-forwarding is a good technique to learn regardless
