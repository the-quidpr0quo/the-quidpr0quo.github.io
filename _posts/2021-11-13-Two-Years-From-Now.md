Hello there, almost two years from now since I started my career at infosec. I am writing to share my unorthdox journey to cybersecurity - from literally nothing to jumping up and down, pivoting left and right until starting to find my initial foothold and attempt to privilege escalate myself. 

**AS** much as I had gained professional knowledge and experience in my previous career (as a financial auditor), it is sad to say they contribute less and less in my infosec journey. Nevertheless, it is fair to say nothing is not important and it is fairer to say to excel in this industry it's the mentality that matters more - how we keep a "try harder" mentality while staying open and admit one's limitations and hack oneself beyond.

I could still remember the very first day I met my first infosec employer, he spoke to me "**You must unlearn what you have learnt before**"

**Milestones and changes log**





Lastly, a little reminder to myself && important 2cents to anyone with zero knowledge/background like me: **Be patient but also be proud of yourself :) **
