Hello there, almost two years from now since I started my career at infosec. I am writing to share my unorthdox journey to cybersecurity - from literally nothing to jumping up and down, pivoting left and right until starting to find my initial foothold and attempt to privilege escalate myself. 

**AS** much as I had gained professional knowledge and experience in my previous career (as a financial auditor), it is sad to say they contribute less and less in my infosec journey. Nevertheless, it is fair to say nothing is not important and it is fairer to say to excel in this industry it's the mentality that matters more - how we keep a "try harder" mentality while staying open and admit one's limitations and hack oneself beyond. And all in all, passion to learn does matter.

I could still remember the very first day I met my first infosec employer, he spoke to me "**You must unlearn what you have learnt before**" I started my career in accounting and finance in Asia - where hierachy matters a lot because there exists the necessity of multiple layers of checks and reviews on work in the hopes of avoiding fraud risks and misstatements. The art of hierachy intensifies further in the finance industry (in particularly in Asia) in the sense that I was educated to make decisions and take actions by submission to the higher ranks. On the contrary, in the infosec industry, knowledge trasnfer and exchange prevail over authoritarian hierachy. To quote Eric Steven Raymond's Freedom is good, "**it's almost a moral duty for you to share information, solve problems and then give the solutions away just so other hackers can solve new problems instead of having to perpetually re-address old ones**"

Thank you KT, for giving me the opportunity in the first place.

Lastly, a little reminder to myself && important 2cents to anyone with zero knowledge/background like me: **Be patient but also be proud of yourself :) **
