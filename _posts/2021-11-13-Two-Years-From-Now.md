Hello there, almost two years from now since I started my career at infosec. I am writing to share my unorthdox journey to cybersecurity - from literally nothing to jumping up and down, pivoting left and right until starting to finding my foothold from blogging my experience - whether about how I managed to escalate to another level or simply a reminder to mistakes that shall never be made a second time.

**Milestones and changes log**
2019 April - Suffered from a mental breakdown and hospitalized twice from a stereotypical career I didn't want to enter at all.
2019 June - Went on a retreat holiday in South East Asia, met IT professionals/digital normads along the way and learnt that everything you could learn are on your fingertips of action to search in google than having the thoughts to blindly follow others' suit. 
2019 July - Continued my old job but started watching python, IT courses on Udemy/Coursera/Virtual Universities
2019 August - Re-contacted friends from university and continued my google research on careers at Information Technology / IT Consultancy, met my future boss in an internview where he was kind enough to offer me the opportunity to start again in the growing/expanding team.
2019 October - Internally transferred to the Cybersecurity Division officially and started my first day figuring how to install a virtual machine, Burp Suite professional etc.
2019 November - Assigned to work on a Anti-virus Implementation Project for another consultancy firm as a project manager ("PM")
