Hello there, almost two years from now since I started my career at infosec. I am writing to share my unorthdox journey to cybersecurity - from nothing to jumping up and down, pivoting left and right until starting to finding my foothold from blogging my experience - whether I managed to hack myself to another level or simply a reminder to mistakes that shall never be made a second time.

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
